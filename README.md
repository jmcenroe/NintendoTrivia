**Nintendo Trivia!**

This app is a timed trivia game. You have 25 seconds to answer eight questions. After all of the questions are answered, click 'Done' to see how you did.

## Motivation

I have been a Nintendo nerd since playing NES as a youngster. I wanted to create a Nintendo trivia game that was fun, challenging, and perhaps a little nostalgic at the same time. 

## To play:

Click "Start Game"
The 45-second timer begins as soon as the next screen appears, showing a list of eight questions with multiple choice or true/false answers.

Click on the radio button ("bubble") next to the best answer for each question. You can choose
only one answer per question.

When you have answered all of the questions, click the "Done" button at the bottom to see how many questions you answered correctly, how many you answered incorrectly, and how many you did not answer.

If the timer goes to zero, the results screen will appear by default.

You can also hit the "Reset" button if you would like to start over before time is up.
