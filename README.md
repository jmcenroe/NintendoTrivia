This app is a timed trivia game. There are You have 15 seconds to answer fifteen questions. After the final question, a results screen will show you how you did.

## Motivation

I have been a Nintendo nerd since playing NES as a youngster. I wanted to create a Nintendo trivia game that was fun, challenging, and perhaps a little nostalgic at the same time. 

## To play:

Click "Start Game"
The 15-second timer begins as soon as the next screen appears, showing a each question individually with multiple choice answers.

Click on the best answer for each question. You can choose only one answer per question.

When you have answered all of the questions, a results screen will show how many questions you answered correctly and how many you answered incorrectly.

If the timer goes to zero, the correct answer will be shown.

On the results screen, you can click "Start Over" if you would like to start the quiz again.
